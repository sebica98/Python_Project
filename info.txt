The first initial stable version of the website is ready.
To test the app you need to install the packages from requirements.txt.
Also in the cart.py from django-shopping-cart package you have to include these 2 methods in the Cart class:
    def get(self, request):
        #get the cart from a request
        self.request = request
        self.session = request.session
        cart = self.session[settings.CART_SESSION_ID].values()
        prices = [float(float(i["price"]) * float(i["quantity"])) for i in cart]
        return sum(prices)

    def restore_stock(self, request):
        #restore the stock of products after clearing the cart
        self.request = request
        self.session = request.session
        cart = self.session[settings.CART_SESSION_ID].values()
        products = {i['product_id']: i['quantity'] for i in cart}
        return products
